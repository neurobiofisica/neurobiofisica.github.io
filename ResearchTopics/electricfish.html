      <h1>Electrocommunication and neural code</h1>
      <p>One of the main issues on modern neuroscience is how to
      decode the so called "neural code".  Somehow all of our sensory
      stimuli are encoded in our neural networks as electric patterns
      of neural activation. As the information flows through the
      cells, the synapses and the internal dynamics <u>process</u>
      this <u>"electric language"</u>, generating behaviours,
      feelings, thoughts; analogous as a processor <u>computes</u>
      a <u>"digital language"</u> into apps, cellphone translate radio
      signals into sound, industrial machines (?) actions. To
      understand what are the <b>transformation rules</b> of this
      language processing tells us what are the limits of the inherent
      process coded by this language.</p>

      <p>Usually, real-time interaction with neurons involves invasive
      procedures, such as cirurgical introduction of electrodes
      (sometime intracellularly), which can interfere on the normal
      behaviour of the system. Despite this limitations, many results
      have been achieved with this kind of studies. However, following
      the Krogh's principle from neuroethology ("for such a large
      number of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few
      such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied")
      some researches found the electric fish as good models for
      developing tools to understand neural code.</p>

      <p>Weakly electric fihes have a self-generated electric pattern,
      very similar to the ondes generated by neurons, which is
      detected by electroreceptors on their skin. By the distortion of
      the expected field of a clean environment, they can use it to
      locate theirselves through the space - called active
      electrolocation. By the dection of other fish discharge, they
      can communicate, solving territorial dominance or sexual
      issues. Their signal can be easily detected by just putting some
      electrodes in the water, without interfering directly with the
      fish physiology. On the other hand, a couple of wires can send a
      electric signal and behave as a "robot fish", allowing a
      real-time "conversation" with a computer model, for example.</p>

      <p>By using Dynamical Systems, Information Theory and Stochastic
      Problems, we can develop tools to make a real-time interaction
      which correlates the fish electric signal with its behaviour to
      create a controlled stimuli, and analyze what are the relevant
      model parameters for the animal communication, and, by that,
      determine the <b>"grammar"</b> of this "language". The
      development of such tools for experimental procedures, data
      analysis and the correlation of that with neural code are the
      main issues of our research.</p>
