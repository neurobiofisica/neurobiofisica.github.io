      <h1>Electrocommunication and neural code</h1>
      <p>One of the main issues on modern neuroscience is how to
      decode the so-called "neural code".  Somehow all of our sensory
      stimuli are encoded in our neural networks as electric patterns
      of neural activation. As the information flows through the
      cells, the synapses and the brain's internal dynamics <u>process</u>
      this "<u>electric language</u>", generating behaviour,
      feelings, thoughts; analogous to how a processor <u>computes</u>
      a "<u>digital language</u>" into apps, a mobile phone translates
	  radio signals into sound, industrial machines produce manufactured
	  goods from raw materials. Understanding the <b>transformation rules</b>
	  involved in this language processing tells us the limits of the
	  inherent process coded by this language.</p>

      <p>Usually, real-time interaction with neurons involves invasive
      procedures, such as cirurgical positioning of electrodes (either
      intracelularly or very near the cell bodies), which may disturb
      the system. Despite these limitations, many results have been
      achieved with this kind of study. However, following the
      Krogh's principle from neuroethology ("for such a large number
      of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such
      animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied") some
      research found out that electric fish might be good toy models
      for neural coding.</p>

      <p>The reason for such a belief resides on the fundamental mechanism
	  involved in the generation of their electric pulses. Weakly electric
	  fish present a self-generated electric pattern, very similar to the
      action potential generated by neurons 
      (<a href="#peixesinal">Figure 1</a>). These pulses are
      detected by electroreceptors on their skin. Using the
      distortions in their train of pulses, they can locate themselves
      in a known environment &ndash; a phenomenon called active
      electrolocation. Additionally, they can also detect pulses from
      other fish, which is likely used for communication (e.g., to
      establish territorial dominance).</p>

      <p>Their signal can be easily detected introducing electrodes in
      the water. This is a completely harmless method, with no need
      for surgery! On the other hand, feedback can be given to the
      fish with a couple of wires sending electric signals. This
      creates two very interesting scenarios: you can have two fishes
      from different aquariums communicating, or even a "model robot
      fish" interacting with a real fish.</p>

      <p>Using techniques from Dynamical Systems, Information Theory
	  and Stochastic Processes, we can develop tools to interact with fish
	  in real-time, correlating the fish electric signal with its
      behaviour to generate controlled stimuli, allowing us to analyze
      the relevant model parameters for animal communication, and
	  therefore to unveil the "<b>grammar</b>" of this "language". The
      development of tools for conducting experiments, for data
      analysis and for correlating the results with a neural code
	  are the main goals of our research.</p>
