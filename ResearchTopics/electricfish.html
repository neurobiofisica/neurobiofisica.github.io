      <h1>Electrocommunication and neural code</h1>
      <p>One of the main issues on modern neuroscience is how to
      decode the so called "neural code".  Somehow all of our sensory
      stimuli are encoded in our neural networks as electric patterns
      of neural activation. As the information flows through the
      cells, the synapses and the internal dynamics <u>process</u>
      this <u>"electric language"</u>, generating behaviours,
      feelings, thoughts; analogous as a processor <u>computes</u>
      a <u>"digital language"</u> into apps, cellphone translate radio
      signals into sound, industrial machines (?) actions. To
      understand what are the <b>transformation rules</b> of this
      language processing tells us what are the limits of the inherent
      process coded by this language.</p>

      <p>Usually, real-time interaction with neurons involves invasive
      procedures, such as cirurgical positioning of electrodes (either
      intracelularly or very near the cell bodies), which may disturb
      the system. Despite these limitations, many results have been
      achieved with this kind of studies. However, following the
      Krogh's principle from neuroethology ("for such a large number
      of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such
      animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied") some
      researches found out that electric fish might be good toy models
      for neural coding.</p>

      <p>The reason why relies on the fundamental mechanism involved
      in their generation of electric pulses. Weakly electric fihes
      have a self-generated electric pattern, very similar to the
      action potential generated by neurons. These pulses are then
      detected by electroreceptors on their skin. Using the
      distortions in their train of pulses, they can locate themselves
      in a known environment - a phenomenon called active
      electrolocation. Additionally, they can also detect pulses from
      other fishes, which is likely used for communication (e.g., to
      establish territorial dominance).</p>

      <p>Their signal can be easily detected introducing electrodes in
      the water. This is a completely hamrless method, with no need
      for surgery! On the other hand, feedback can be given to the
      fish with a couple of wires sending electric signals. This
      creates two very interesting scenarios: you can have two fishes,
      from different aquariums communicating or even a "model robot
      fish" interacting with a real fish.</p>

      <p>By using Dynamical Systems, Information Theory and Stochastic
      Problems (processes??), we can develop tools to make real-time
      interaction which correlates the fish electric signal with its
      behaviour to create a controlled stimuli, and analyze what are
      the relevant model parameters for the animal communication, and,
      by that, determine the <b>"grammar"</b> of this "language". The
      development of such tools for experimental procedures, data
      analysis and the correlation of that with neural code are the
      main issues of our research.</p>
