      <h1>Large Networks Simulations</h1>

      <p>
	After you have a basic model that should describe a
	phenomenon, you can simulate your model for basically two
	reasons: (i) validate the model and learn its limits of
	application; (ii) make new hypothesis and suggest new
	experiments. Several scientists believe that being able to
	describe an effect in mathematical terms and reproduce
	it <i>in silico</i> is the ultimate endgame in understanding
	the true nature behind the effect.
      </p>

      <p>
	In our lab, We are especially interested in complex phenomena
	that can arise from large networks. In Statistical Physics,
	this is a widely spread notion: it's quite frequent that
	effects arising from simple, coupled units seem more complex
	than the sum of their effects separately.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Critical networks and psychophysics</h2>
      

      <p>
	One of our main interests rely on how complex behavior emerge
	from networks of simple neurons. Several network properties
	are believed to be enhanced whenever you tune your network to
	a very specific, (dis)organized state. This state oftenly lies
	in the border between two very distinct regions in terms of
	how the network behaves. Also frequently, the biological
	systems being studied tend to remain in these systems.
	Although the reason is not fully understood, it seems a very
	practical solution nature has found to optimize the
	operational properties of its systems. With this in mind, and
	importing notions from Out-of-Equilibrium Statical Physics,
	people call it a Critical State.

      <p>
	Let's focus our discussion: the dynamic range of a neural
	network measures the extent to which this network can
	understand the stimuli. In terms of audition: what's the range
	in frequency in which your years can distinguish between one
	note and another note? The size of this range (usually
	measured in decibels) is its dynamic range. For vision, you
	can think of the range of luminosity in which your eyes are
	able to distinguish how bright the light is.
      </p>

      <p>
	The interesting thing is that models and experiments suggest
	that the dynamic range of a neural network is optimized in a
	critical state.

      <p>
	Below you'll find videos of simulations of a network in the
	three possible states: subcritical, critical and
	supercritical. The yellow dot represents the source of
	excitation: we are manually inducing spikes there with a fixed
	frequency. These simulations were designed using a square
	lattice, creating a natural spatial notion of
	neighbourhood. Notice how in the supercritical case, the
	activity seems to sometimes live undefinitely.

      <h2>Dynamical (and complex) Systems</h2>
      
      <p>
	Critical systems are not the only source of interesting
	phenomena: the more realistic a models demand a considerable
	increase in the model complexity. For example, some
	conductance models may have 16 dimensions per neuron, i.e.,
	there are 16 equations per neuron to be solved
	simultaneously. Don't forget they are all coupled!  The
	advantage of having more realiastic dynamics is that you have
	a closer link between your model and the physiological
	parameters in the laboratory. However, there's a price to pay:
	the networks are usually smaller and you start having huge
	numerical challenges.
