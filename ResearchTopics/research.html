      <h1>Why Neurobiophysics?</h1>
      <p>In the recent past, there has been a significant increase in
      Biology research by the so-called exact sciences, such as
      Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science.  For example, complex
      algorithms for processing human genome data were developed by
      researchers whose main background was not in Biology.</p>
      
      <p>This seems to be particularly true in Neuroscience. In the
	past few decades, exciting advances have been (and are still
	being) reached, such as the identification of neuronal
	synaptic pathways and receptive fields, in an attempt to
	understand the information flow from the sensory organs to the
	cortex and back to the motor system. However we still don't
	have a quantitative knowledge on how they relate and on how it
	works. Basically, we don't have a cheap robot able to buy our
	breakfast on the nearest bakery. We can say that
	we <u>understand</u> a biological system only when we are able
	to build a similar tool with similar efficiency. Physicists
	are confident that they can make a great contribution to this
	effort, isolating a biological subsystem and learning from the
	biologists which variables and parameters can be
	controlled.</p>
      
      <p>One of our goals is to analyze the brain and its constituints
      from the Complex Systems viewpoint and to obtain a structural
      understanding from its dynamics. Monitoring the brain activity
      using techniques from Physics provoked a true revolution,
      enabling the researcher almost to "read the thoughts" of the
      subject. Multi-electrode registration made it possible to
      acquire a large amount of data simultaneously, which boosted the
	development of new mathematical techniques to analyze it.</p>
      
      <p>We are, nonetheless, very far away from an understanding of
      the brain's modus operandi. To approach this herculean task, the
      most obvious thing to do is to investigate simpler systems,
      mimicking Galileo on his famous free fall studies. Nature tends
      to recycle solutions that worked in simpler situations. The
      greatest difficulty involved in using the experimental and
      theoretical background from Physics in biological research is to
      conduct <i>in vivo</i> experiments and to analyze their results
      in a context where a lot of parameters exist to be observed and
      controlled, and where interference on the animal behaviour must
      be kept to a minimum. Besides, all results, when obtained on the
      same conditions, shoud be reproducible within permissible errors
      due to the unavoidable biological noise.</p>
