      <h1>Why Neurobiophysics?</h1>
      <p>In recent past, Biology research has been increasingly
      receiving contributions from the so-called Exact Sciences, such
      as Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. Among new
      disciplines created by this movement are Systems Biology and
      BioInformatics. For example, complex algorithms for processing
      human genome data were developed by researchers whose main
      background was not in Biology.</p>

          neural network.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>This seems to be particularly true in Neuroscience, and
      culminated in the creation of a very interdisciplinary field
      called Computational Neuroscience. In the past few decades,
      exciting advances have been achieved, and almost everyday are
      published novel and appealing findings all over the world. For
      instance, the identification of neuronal synaptic pathways
      (<a href="network">Figure 1</a>) and
      receptive fields, allied with computational techniques, give us
      the opportunity to study information flow, starting from sensory
      organs, in the peripheral nervous system, all the way to the
      cortex and back to the motor system.

      <p>We are, however, far from quantitatively understanding the
      whole picture: how these systems communicate and relate. For
      instance, we still do not have a cheap robot able to buy our
      breakfast for us in the nearest coffee shop. We can only say that
      we <u>understand</u> a biological system when we are able to
      build a similar tool with similar efficiency. In this sense,
      physicists are confident that they can make great contributions,
      isolating biological subsystems and learning from the biologists
      which variables and parameters should be controlled.</p>

          <img src="../Fotos/mosca/spikeIntel1.jpg" id="spikes" name="spikes" />
          <figcaption><b>Figure 2:</b>Neurons translate the stimulus into
          their own electrical language of pulses, called action potentials
          or spikes</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>One of our goals is to analyze the brain and its constituents
      from the Complex Systems viewpoint and to obtain a structural
      understanding of its dynamics. Monitoring the brain activity
      (<a href="#spikes">Figure 2</a>)
      using techniques from Physics provoked a true revolution,
      enabling the researcher almost to "read the thoughts" of the
      subject. Multi-electrode registration made it possible to
      acquire large amounts of data while an experiment was performed,
      which also boosted the development of new mathematical
      techniques to analyze this data.</p>
      
      <p>We are, nonetheless, very far away from an understanding of
      the brain's modus operandi. To approach this herculean task, the
      most obvious thing to do is to investigate simpler systems,
      mimicking Galileo on his famous free fall studies. Nature tends
      to recycle solutions that worked in simpler situations. The
      greatest obstacle involved in using the experimental and
      theoretical background from Physics in a biological research is
      to conduct <i>in vivo</i> experiments and to analyze their
      results in a context where the most significant parameters can
      be measured and controlled, while minimizing interference with
      the animal behaviour. Finally, all results should be
      reproducible within permissible errors due to the unavoidable
      biological noise.</p>
