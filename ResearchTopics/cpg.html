      <p>
	One of the key mechanism underneath the generation of complex
	behavior and patterns is in the coordinated dynamics generated
	by neural circuits and networks. The mainstream hypotehsis is
	currently that the emergent complex dynamics can generate both
	low level behavior (motor patterns, sensory systems, learning,
	etc) and high level cognitive processes (sentiments,
	conscience itself, etc). We are, however, just scrapping the
	surface of the real understanding of these phenomena. In this
	sense, one may ask...
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>How to generally extract the information stored in a given pattern?</li>
	<li>What are the minimal conditions to generate a similar
	pattern, carrying the same amount of information?</li>
	<li>is it possible to create a neural chip that perfectly
	substitutes an impaired cell?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Central Pattern Generators are among the favorite systems
      used to answer such questions. They are usually small circuits,
      capable of generating rhythms in an almost self-suficient
      fashion. Even when detached from the nervous system, if
      appropriately mantained (chemically and physically), they can
      sustain their rhythm indefinitely. This robustness make them
      perfect circuits to mantain vital patterns, such ass breathing,
      cardiac cycles, chewing, walking, etc.</p>

	One example of such network is the Stomatogastric Nervous
	System of crustaceans, studied for over 30
	years. Prof. Reynaldo Pinto, our group leader, brought this
	research in the earlier 2000's to Brazil, in our
	lab. Particularly, he focused on a specific ganglion composed
	by few tens of neurons, known as Stomatogastric Ganglion
	(STG). Its main function is to generate peristaltic moviments
	in the crustaceans intenstin that push food inward to be
	digested. Especially because this is a rather small circuit,
	it's well studied and its neurons are well categorized in
	terms of their intrinsec dynamics and function. It's
	connectivity is also well accepted throughout the scientific
	community, which makes the STG a perfect benchmark to
	understand rhythms generation and information
	processing/transmission.

	As physicists, our main interest is to understand these
	aspects using Information Theory, Dynamical Systems and Signal
	Processing.
