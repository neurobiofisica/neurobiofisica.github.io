        <h1>Dynamics and Information of<br />"simple" neural networks</h1>

      <p>
	One of the fundamental hypothesis behind modern neuroscience
	is that emergent patterns observed in neural systems somehow
	converge to produce both low level
	behaviour (motor patterns, sensing, learning, etc) and high
	level cognitive processes (sentiments, conscience itself,
	etc); the core ingredients to maintain life. One of
	the key mechanisms underneath the generation of such complex
	patterns is in the coordinated dynamics of neural circuits and
	networks.  We are, however, just scrapping the surface in
	terms of understanding of how patterns encode information, or
	how this information is furhter combined to sustain life
	itself. In this sense, we may ask...
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>How to generally extract the information stored in a given
	pattern?</li>
	<li>What are the minimal conditions to generate a similar
	pattern, carrying the same amount of information?</li>
	<li>Is it possible to create a neural chip that perfectly
	substitutes an impaired cell?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Central Pattern Generators are among the favourite systems
      used to answer such questions. They are usually small circuits,
      capable of generating rhythms in an almost self-sufficient
      fashion. Even when detached from the nervous system, if
      appropriately maintained (chemically and physically), they can
      sustain their rhythm indefinitely. This robustness make them
      perfect circuits to maintain vital patterns, such ass breathing,
      cardiac cycles, chewing, walking, etc.</p>

      <p>
	One example of such network is the Stomatogastric Nervous
    System of crustaceans (<a href="#cpg">Figure 1</a>), studied for over 30
	years. Prof. Reynaldo Pinto, our group leader, brought this
	research in the earlier 2000's to Brazil, in our
	lab. Particularly, he focused on a specific ganglion composed
	by few tens of neurons, known as Stomatogastric Ganglion
	(STG). Its main function is to generate peristaltic movements
	in the crustaceans intestine that push food inward to be
	digested. Especially because this is a rather small circuit,
	it's well studied and its neurons are well categorized in
	terms of their intrinsic dynamics and function. It's
	connectivity is also well accepted throughout the scientific
	community, which makes the STG a perfect benchmark to
	understand rhythms generation and information
	processing/transmission.
      </p>

      <p>
	As physicists, our main interest is to understand these
	aspects using Information Theory, Dynamical Systems and Signal
    Processing. We show next some of the conclusions we got by using
    these mathematicals tools:

          <figcaption><b>Figure 2</b> First return map (see text) of a neuron
          in the Stomatogastric Ganglion (STG). The patterns seen in these maps are 
          almost unique signatures of each neuron in the STG, summarizing inner 
          properties of its dynamics.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
    <p>
    Despite the old belief that nerons are just "conductors" to
    transmit the information and the processing actually occurs on the
    set of synapses on the soma, nowadays there are plenty evidence
    that each neuron has its own dynamics that can be tuned by protein
    expression or chemical concentrations. On the stomatogastric
    ganglion we have shown that each neuron can be individually
    described by the its geometry of his "First Return Map".  To
    construct this map, we take each spike we recorded and plot (i) in
    the x-axis the time interval between this spike and its
    predecessor - i.e., the previous spike; (ii) in the y-axis we
    insert the time interval between this same spike and the next
    one. We show an example in <a href="#fig">Figure 2</a>. Finally,
    the color represents the quantity of points on that region: the
    mor clear, the higher the number of points in a particular
    region. What makes Frist Return Maps so interesting, especially in
    STGs, is that they carry a lot of information regarding the inner
    properties of the underlying dynamics of the neuron being
    analyzed. In fact, the patterns seen in these maps work almost as
    unique signatures, distinguishing neurons with markedly different
    behaviors and dynamics. These "shapes" also depend on the
    connectivity of the network.
      </p>

      <p>
    By connecting neurons to computer models using electrodes that can inject
    a current dependent of the electric activity (Dynamic Clamp protocol), we 
    also measured the information quantity (in bits) that is transmitted in a 
    single synapse between cells of the stomatogastric ganglion, reflecting 
    how much "degrees of freedom" the circuit can tune, how much behaviours it
    can assume.
