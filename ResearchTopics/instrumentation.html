      <h1>Dedicated Computational Instrumentation</h1>
        <p>To understand scientifially a system consist in predict how a it will modify its
        environment and adapt itself dynamically to a certain set of stimuli. Although certain
        systems respond linearlly, allowing reduct the comprehension of the whole to the
        comprehension of it parts, usually biological systems are highly non-linear, 
        showing behaviours dependent of the past history, complex dynamics and stochastic
        properties. Study this phenomenas demands highly controlled and highly reproducible
        experiments, only possible by dedicated instrumentation.</p>

        <p>Despite the existance of several commercial solutions, as the state-of-art experiments
        become more complex, the instrumentation complexity for parameter control increases equally,
        which demands dedicated local solutions with high technical quality. A multidisciplinary team is 
        necessary for such development, envolving biology, chemestry, real-time operating systems,
        low-level driver development, digital signal processing, graphical interfaces, analog and digital
        electronics, mathemathics and physics.</p>

        <p>Our group makes state-of-art computational instrumentation (<a href="#intel">Figure 1</a>) 
        for more than 20 years,
        using programmable logic devices (FPGA - dedicated logic circuits) and electronics with
        the most contemporary programming paradigms (Functional programming, for example) to
        develop dedicated hardware for closed-loop experiments (biological-electrical interface, 
        acquisition system, host computer with real-time operating system, stimuli controller and 
        stimuli generator).</p>

      <h1>VSImG and the fly visual system</h1>

        <p>The fly has a very high speed visual perception (500Hz, in contrast with the
        about 30Hz for humans), which makes common monitors inadequate experiments with such animal. To
        exemplify the complexity of such requirement, for a 256x256 monochromatic picture, there 
        is 64 KBytes per frame. In a 500Hz rate, we need a 31 MBytes/s bus speed communication. To make
        things worse, we must assure determinism, i.e., independent of the computer usage, operational
        system schedule, network package income, or anything else, the simuli must be generated with 
        the same rate, with no delay or timing correction. This high-speed communication must also 
        consider the length of the wire as well as the connectors impedance. In our laboratory, 
        a complete visual generator was made (<a href="#instrumentation">Figure 2</a>) using Tektronix<sup>&reg;</sup> X-Y video monitor drivered by 
        dedicated electronics (analogous to a video board) that can be controlled by a computer 
        using a common parallel port interface (old printer connector).
        This system is controlled by a Linux Real-Time operating system (RTAI - Real Time 
        Application Interface) with a Graphical User Interface build with Python Language.
        More details of this equipment are described in this
