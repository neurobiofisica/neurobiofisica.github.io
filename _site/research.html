      <h1>Why Neurobiophysics?</h1>
      <p>On the recent past, there has been a significantly increase on biology researches
      by the so called exact sciences, such as physics, mathemathics and computer science.
      As an example, complex algorithm are been developed by researches without background in
      biology for data processing of the human genome.</p>
      <p>This seems to be particularly true in the Neurosciences. Since a few decades, exciting
      advances have and are been reached, such as identify neuronal sinaptic pathways and receptive
      fields in an attempt to understante de information flux from the sensory organs to the cortex
      and back do the motor system. However we still don't have a quantitative knowledge of how this
      this relate and how they work. Basically, we don't have a cheap robot able to buy our breakfast
      on the nearest bakery. We only can say that we <u>understand</u> a biological system when we
      are able to build a similar tool with similar efficiency. Physicists are confident that they
      can make a great contribution on this effort, isolating a biological subsystem and learn from
      the biologists what are the variables and parameters which can be controlled.</p>
      <p>One of our goals is to analyse the brain and its constituints from the Complex Systems
      approach and to obtain a structural understading from its dynamics. To monitor the brain
      activity using technics from the physics provoked a truly revolution, allowing the researcher
      to almost "read the thoughts" of the subject. Multi-electrode registering made possible to
      acquire a large amount of data simultaneously, which boosted the development of new mathematical
      techniques to analyse it.</p>
      <p>We are, nonetheless, very far away from a understanding of the brain modus operandi. To
      approach this herculean task, the most obvious thig to do is investigate simpler systems, mimicking
      Galileu on his famous free fall studies. Nature tends to recycle solutions that worked in simpler
      situations. The greates difficulty to use the experimental and theoretical practices oh Physics
      to biological researches if to make <i>in vivo</i> experiments and analyse them in a context with
      a lot of parameters to be observed and controlled with a minimum interference on the animal behaviour.
      Besides, all the results, when on same conditions, shoud be reproducible within permissible errors
      and unavoidable biological noise.
